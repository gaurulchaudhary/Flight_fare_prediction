**Flight Fare Prediction Project**

The goal of this project is to predict flight fares based on historical data, providing insights into the factors that influence ticket prices. Using machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques, this project aims to forecast future flight fares with a high degree of accuracy.

**Key Features:**
- **Data Collection:** The dataset includes features such as airline, flight date, source, destination, duration, stops, and number of passengers.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Missing values are handled, categorical data is encoded, and numerical features are scaled to ensure optimal model performance.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A comprehensive analysis of the dataset identifies patterns and correlations between different features, such as seasonality and peak travel periods, that affect fare prices.
- **Model Building:** Various machine learning models, including XGBoost, are applied to predict flight fares. XGBoost was selected as a top performer for this task due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships and large datasets efficiently.
- **Evaluation:** The models are evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ². The final XGBoost model achieved an impressive accuracy of 84%, demonstrating its robustness in predicting flight fare prices.
